            q1: "What constitutes a total loss in Texas?",
            a1: "In Texas, a car is a total loss if the repair costs equal or exceed 100% of the vehicle’s actual cash value (ACV).",
            q2: "Can I keep my totaled car in Texas?",
            a2: "Yes, this is called 'owner retention'. The insurance company will deduct the salvage value from your settlement.",
            q3: "Does Texas have a 'Right to Appraisal'?",
            a3: "Most policies include an Appraisal Clause, allowing you to hire an independent appraiser to dispute low offers.",
            // New FAQs
            q4: "What should I do immediately after an accident?",
            a4: "First, ensure safety and call 911 if injured. Exchange insurance info, take photos of the scene and plates, and seek medical attention immediately, even if you feel fine. Report the incident to your insurer but do not give a recorded statement without advice.",
            q5: "How long do I have to file a claim in Texas?",
            a5: "Texas has a 2-year Statute of Limitations for injury claims. However, waiting can hurt your case as evidence disappears. It is vital to act quickly.",
            q6: "What damages can I recover?",
            a6: "You may recover Medical Bills, Lost Wages, Property Damage, Pain & Suffering, and sometimes Diminished Value. The specific amount depends on liability and policy limits.",
            q7: "How long does it take to settle?",
            a7: "Simple claims may settle in a few months. Complex injury cases or those requiring litigation can take longer. We push for a timely but fair resolution, not a quick lowball."
